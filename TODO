+ [from V. Lefe`vre] test the default mode (in particular the precision)
  like in http://www.vinc17.org/software/tst-ieee754.c
+ [from V. Lefe`vre] check special values too (NaN, inf, ...)
+ Support for external check.
+ check the "inexact" flag: for glibc, it is not aimed to be correct except
  for functions such as fma
+ check underflows: no underflows should be missed by glibc, but we can get
  some spurious underflows
+ check ERANGE: glibc only sets it for 0 or +/-Inf, not for +/-DBL_MIN or
  the +/- DBL_MAX
