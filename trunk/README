This program tests the accuracy of elementary functions of
mathematical libraries.

By default, it tests the standard mathematical library (libm).

Other libraries can be checked:

- Mathlib

- LIBMCR: it checks Sun's libmcr double-precision library,
  available at <http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=41797765>.
  Version 0.9 of libmcr implements exp, log, pow, atan, sin, cos, tan,
  for all four standard rounding modes.

- CRLIBM:

- PARI:

- NTL:

- CLN:


It detects which libraries are present and are usable at configure time.
