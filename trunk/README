This program tests the accuracy of elementary functions of
mathematical libraries.

By default, it tests the standard mathematical library (libm).

Other libraries can be checked:

- with -DMATHLIB, it checks IBM's MathLib (libultim) double-precision
  library, which only implements rounding to nearest.

- with -DLIBMCR, it checks Sun's libmcr double-precision library,
  available at <http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=41797765>.
  Version 0.9 of libmcr implements exp, log, pow, atan, sin, cos, tan,
  for all four standard rounding modes.
  Add -I<libmcr>/include to CFLAGS, and <libmcr>/lib/libmcr.a to LDFLAGS.
