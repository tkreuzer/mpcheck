You need to install:
	GMP 4.1.0
	MPFR 2.2.0 (Because versions < 2.2.0 don't handle well overflow).

If you download the CVS version, you need also the autotools.
Run this command to generate the missing files:
	autoreconf -i

Once they are installed, use the classic way to install this program:

	./configure
	make
	make check
	make install

Use ./configure --help to get more options.

A more typical way is:
 ./configure --with-mpfr=/localdisk/libs --with-gmp=/localdisk/libs CPPFLAGS="-I/localdisk/libs/include" LDFLAGS="-L/localdisk/libs/lib"
 assuming all the libraries have been installed in /localdisk/libs/.
